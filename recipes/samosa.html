    <p>A samosa is a fried South Asian and West Asian snack. It is a pastry with a savory filling that mostly consists of vegetables like spiced potatoes, onions, and peas, but can also include meat, fish, or cheese. Its name originates from the Middle Persian word sambosag. It is made in different shapes, including triangular, cone, or crescent, depending on the region. Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier. Sweet versions are also made. Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of South Asia, Southeast Asia, West Asia, Central Asia, Portugal, East Africa and their South Asian diasporas. </p>
