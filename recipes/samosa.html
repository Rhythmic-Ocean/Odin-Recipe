            A samosa is a fried South Asian and West Asian snack. It is a pastry with a savory filling that mostly
            consists of vegetables like spiced potatoes, onions, and peas, but can also include meat, fish, or cheese.
            Its name originates from the Middle Persian word sambosag. It is made in different shapes, including
            triangular, cone, or crescent, depending on the region. Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and
            have origins in medieval times or earlier. Sweet versions are also made. Samosas are a popular entrée,
            appetizer, or snack across South Asia, Southeast Asia, West Asia, Central Asia, Portugal, East Africa,
            and the South Asian diaspora.
